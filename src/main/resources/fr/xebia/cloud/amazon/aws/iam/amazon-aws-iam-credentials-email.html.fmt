Hello, <br/>
<br/>
Here are the credentials to connect to Xebia Amazon AWS/EC2 training infrastructure. <br/>
<br/>
Don't hesitate to connect to Amazon AWS, to play with it but please <strong>do not forget to stop instances or if possible terminate them after using them</strong>.
Letting instances started would cost unnecessary money to Xebia.
</p>
